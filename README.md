# FinalYearProj

This is my university final year project where I built a test-rig for an autonomous interplanetary rover. There are two main codes, one that calculates the distance to the nearest obstacle in order to avoid it while transmitting data from a camera to a website and one that allows for a manual takeover of the rover. 

Components used:
Raspberry Pi 3B+
MotorShield for Raspberry Pi
2x Motors
USB camera
2x LIDAR sensors
2x battery packs
MakerBeam chassis
